# Send your friends free Grundgesetze

### A small project to test Selenium's capabilities

This script automatically sends up to six Grundgesetze (the German Basic Law) provided for free by the Bundeszentrale f√ºr politische Bildung (the German Federal Agency for Civic Education). The automatic process of clicking through the ordering process on the [main URL](https://www.bpb.de/shop/buecher/grundgesetz/34367/grundgesetz-fuer-die-bundesrepublik-deutschland/) was done with Selenium.

###  How to execute this script
1. Install requirements.txt
2. Edit adress.cfg with your desired shipping adress and the amount (the maximum free amount is six)
3. Run main.py
